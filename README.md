I created the [data_processing.py](https://github.com/kumarsoma/house_price_prediction/blob/master/data_processing.py) module which consists of functions required for processing the Test Set and Submission Set in [house_price_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/kumarsoma/house_price_prediction/blob/master/house_price_prediction.ipynb)

The datasets used in this project can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
